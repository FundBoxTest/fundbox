Post Scriptum:
==============
Please take under consideration that it is my first time playing with cypress framework and JS language
If i had more time i would learn how to loop through objects with JS+Cypres and whould implement the search repository function
differently.
Instead of going to a specific page i whould create a loop that iterates throug elements with "each" command on existing page results until no pages left and finds the repository i am looking for.

Unfortunatly i need more time to learn how to do it.

Thanks for the given opportunity.
